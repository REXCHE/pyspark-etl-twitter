# Real-Time Tweet Sentiment Analysis with Docker, Kafka and Spark Streaming
This project is the continuation of a first one where I compared several classification algorithms implemented in PySpark on a sentiment analysis task. 

In this repository, you will find the implementation of an ETL process for sentimental analysis of tweets in real time. For this, I used Docker, Apache Kafka and Spark Streaming. The results of this analysis can be displayed in a console, saved locally, saved to a MongoDB database or to a data lake such as Delta Lake.

For more details on how this project works, how to create Topic Kafka, etc, I invite you to read my article on Medium about this project. I detail all the implementation steps!
